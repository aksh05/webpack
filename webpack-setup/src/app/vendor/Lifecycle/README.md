### Data flow

Action ==> Dispatcher ==> Store ==> View

* Action : Can be generated by View or AJAX.     
     
    ```{
        action : "TYPE",
        payload : "DATA"
    }```

* Dispatcher : Notify Store about action.
* Store : Common place to hold state and reducers.    
* View : These are webcomponents with notion of stateless and statefull components.

Stateless web components | Statelfull web components
------------------------ | ------------------------
These do not have any state data that can change after they are renderd. | These do have state data that can change after they are renderd.
Can only have stateless child | Can have both stateless or statefull child.
Rendered props using ES6 interpolation | Render state using jQuery or VDOM









### Offline storage
#### Terms
Replication |	Hydration
----------- |  -----------
Save application state into DB | Load saved state to memory 
Is done on state change | Is done on application load

#### Strategies    
* Subscribe state change    
* Subscribe state change with debounce     

#### Example

An app state which will be replicated to DB on state change.
```javascript
{
   "pendingActions": [{
       "url": "/apply",
       "data": {
           "jobId": 2
       }
   }],
   "jobs" : [{
   	"jobId" : 1,
   	"title" : "Oracle Front end engg",
   	"saved" : false,
   	"applied" : true
   },{
   	"jobId" : 2,
   	"title" : "Microsoft Front end engg",
   	"saved" : false,
   	"applied" : false
   }] 
}
```
